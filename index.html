  <h1>411 Project Plan</h1>
  <p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    For my project, I want to make an event planning application.
    My goal is to make an app that lets people organize events, invite people, and define other parts of a party.
    I would like to include accounts to keep track of multiple invitations, item lists for BYOB events, Google Maps
    integration for quick access to the event location, and a chat feature that all invited guests could use.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <h5>Technologies</h5>
    For technologies, I will mostly be relying on SpringMVC and RESTful.
    I would like to integrate the API for Google Maps to show locations for events you've been invited to,
    or possibly even show the locations of multiple parties you've been invited to in one place.<br>
    <h5>Use Cases</h5>
    For my use cases, core functionality would include:
    <ul>
      <li>Creating an account with your name and email address</li>
      <li>Logging in with an email address and password</li>
      <li>Sending invites other people using email address</li>
      <li>Accessing a page for details about a specific party</li>
    </ul>
    After those core tasks are completed, more beneficial functionality would be added based on priority.
    Throughout the timeline of the project, I want to include:
    <ul>
      <li>An item list for people to bring items</li>
      <li>Google Maps integration for quick access to directions</li>
      <li>Event chat to allow communication between guests</li>
    </ul>
    This list contains functionality that I currently wish to integrate. Obviously, the largest portion of this will be
    making sure the MySQL integrates well and the schema for the database makes sense given the context of the application.
    This list will be updated throughout the course of the project to reflect what can actually be done with the time given.
    <h5>Other Design Docs</h5>
    I've created some design documentation and added a readme with this information as well. I'll put the links down below.</br>
    One of the documents is a click-through UI mockup that I created in Adobe XD CC. It's not fully created yet, but it conveys what I'm aiming for.<br>
    The other link is a public Google Drive folder that will be the home for Draw.io diagrams, mockups, and any other files that are relevant to the project.<br><br>

    <h3>Schedule</h3>
    This is a rough outline I've generated to give an idea of when I'll be doing each piece of my
    project. We haven't been given exact dates when each checkpoint will be graded, so I've tried to distribute work as best as possible.
    <h5>Checkpoint 1</h5>
    Before this checkpoint is graded, I want to have completed some design docs to help facilitate
    implementation, specifically the database design. This is also where I want to have the groundwork for the project done. Setting up
    the server and getting it to display some webpages. I would also like to start implementing the base tables in MySQL.
    <h5>Checkpoint 2</h5>
    At this checkpoint, I want to have the basic functions mentioned above implemented and fully
    functional. This shouldn't be too difficult, so I will be using any free time to research implementation
    of the other use cases that I feel would have the biggest impact on the app.
    <h5>Checkpoint 3</h5>
    This checkpoint is where I want to have at least one of my unique use cases implemented.
    Once one is implemented, I can start working on the next unique use case. Keep in mind
    that this will all be concurrent with research on my next possible feature.
    <h5>Final</h5>
    For the final, I think I would like to have 2 or 3 non-essential features implemented.
    This will no doubt change over the course of the next few weeks, but it all depends on time and any issues
    I may have with other features.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Justification</h3>
    <h5>Novelty</h5>
    I'm not aiming to create something amazing with this application, but I do think this idea has
    enough unique features to make it something that fits a niche market of people. There
    are alternatives to individual features; you can chat on Messenger, text your address to people, or create a
    Facebook event for your party, but I think tying these specific features together allows
    for a much nicer way to get people together and organize an event.<br>
    I see a few issues with what currently exists. They aren't cohesive, they're fragmented portions of an app
    that don't fully support an event-centered use case. Facebook event pages are close, but it's still focused on
    posts, which is not intuitive for an event. There are no lists for items on Facebook, you can't send the directions
    to your phone through Google Maps, you can't easily chat about the event with the other guests outside of posts unless you use
    Messenger, and you can't see all the events you've been invited to without digging through the rest of Facebook's endless side panel.
    <h5>Complexity</h5>
    This is a complex application. Not as complex as some corporate software, but complex for
    a single person to create. Dealing with SpringMVC and RESTful will be difficult enough, but
    the complexity of the database and SQL will be a welcome challenge. The database schema will be extremely complicated
    to determine with new event pages being created, new users, and different details for each event.
