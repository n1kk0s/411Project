    <h3>Description</h3>
    For my project, I'm thinking about making a social party application.
    My goal is to make an app that lets people organize events, invite people, and define other parts of a party.
    Some ideas I've considered include using Google Maps to show party location, having a food list for a potluck,
    or possibly adding a chat feature if time allows.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <h5>Technologies</h5>
    For technologies, I haven't considered many APIs or libraries outside of SpringMVC and RESTful.
    One thing I think would be really interesting to add would be Google Maps to show locations for the party,
    or possibly even show the locations of multiple parties you've been invited to in one place.<br>
    I would also use Android or iOS app notifications if I decide to go with a full-fledged app.
    <h5>Use Cases</h5>
    For my use cases, I think the basic ones are:
    <ul>
      <li>being able to log in with an email address and password</li>
      <li>inviting other people to parties using email address or phone number</li>
      <li>seeing details about a specific party</li>
    </ul>
    After those core tasks are completed, I plan to pick and choose more beneficial use cases to the app.
    Some use cases that I would like to add at some point throughout the timeline of the project:
    <ul>
      <li>list feature, allowing people to volunteer to bring certain items</li>
      <li>maps, so you can see the exact location of a party and open it in Google Maps</li>
      <li>chat, for communication about the party</li>
    </ul>
    Of course these are just a few of the ideas that have popped into my head, and new ones will no doubt
    be added to this list to make sure it reflects what I'm realisticly able to do with the given time.
    <h5>Other Design Docs</h5>
    I don't currently have any other design docs. Deciding on a project that wasn't complete garbage
    took up a lot of my time. Up until the first checkpoint, I will make a few mockups and some diagrams
    to help with visualization of the project and how the pieces will work together.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Schedule</h3>
    This is a rough outline I've generated to give an idea of when I'll be doing each piece of my
    project. We haven't been given exact dates when each checkpoint will be graded, so I am going to
    try to distribute work as best as possible.
    <h5>Checkpoint 1</h5>
    Before this checkpoint is graded, I want to have completed some design docs to help facilitate
    implementation, specifically the database design. This is also where I want to have the groundwork for the project done. Setting up
    the server and getting it to display some webpages. I would also like to start implementing the base tables in MySQL.
    <h5>Checkpoint 2</h5>
    At this checkpoint, I want to have the basic functions mentioned above implemented and fully
    functional. This shouldn't be too difficult, so I will be using any free time to research implementation
    of the other use cases that I feel would have the biggest impact on the app.
    <h5>Checkpoint 3</h5>
    This checkpoint is where I want to have at least one of my unique use cases implemented.
    Once one is implemented, I can start working on the next unique use case. Keep in mind
    that this will all be concurrent with research on my next possible feature.
    <h5>Final</h5>
    For the final, I think I would like to have 2 or 3 non-essential features implemented.
    While it's not 100% realistic, I would like to get an Android application up and running as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Justification</h3>
    <h5>Novelty</h5>
    I'm no Steve Jobs, so I'm not starting the next big thing, but I do think this idea has
    enough unique features to make it something that fits a niche market of people. There
    are alternatives to individual features; you can chat on Messenger, text your address to people, or create a
    Facebook event for your party, but I think tying these specific features together allows
    for a much nicer way to get people together and organize an event.
    <h5>Complexity</h5>
    This is a complex application. Not as complex as some corporate software, but complex for
    a single person to create. Dealing with SpringMVC and RESTful will be difficult enough, but
    the complexity of the database and SQL will be a nice challenge. In addition to that, using
    APIs and (potentially) Android development will also create a huge mountain of knowledge to
    get through.
